### What Is Microservices?

Microservices are like breaking an app into smaller, independent pieces. These independent parts can work on their own but together form a complete application. It's like a pizza, and each slice is one microservice. Each single slice, or one microservice, performs a specific roleâ€”for example, user login or processing payments. In this way, all the rest could be fixed or updated without any effect.

### How to Create AI-Based Microservices

1. **Define the Task**: Decide what exactly you want the AI to do, like recommending products or answering customer questions.
2. **Decompose**: Break the AI task into subtasks. For example, one subtask could be getting data, another one would train the AI model, and yet another one would involve making predictions.
3. **Build Each Part**: Develop and test each microservice individually. Pack them using tools like Docker, making them run in any place.
4. **Connect Them**: Ensure that these microservices are able to communicate with each other using APIs (in a way, it's like the messengers for apps).
5. **Deploy and Scale**: Use tools like Kubernetes to scale and manage the microservices across operations.

Breaking down the AI tasks to microservices, on the other hand, simplifies system management, updating, and scaling.
